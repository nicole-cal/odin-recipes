        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.</p>
          <p>There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
              <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
              <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
              <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
              <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
              <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
              <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
              <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
              <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
          </ol>
